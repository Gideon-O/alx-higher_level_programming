# Python Errors and Exceptions
There can be Syntax/Parsing erros or Exceptions
- Syntax errors: The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected.
- Exceptions: Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal.
